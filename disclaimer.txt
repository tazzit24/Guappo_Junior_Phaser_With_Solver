"Guappo Junior" is a game inspired by the original "Wapppo Junior" made by "Softex Digital" for "Siemens Mobile".
It was originally developped in Java ME with the Siemens Mobile framework.
Softex Digial does not exists anymore and their 20 years old game is now abandonware.

My Siemens C65 broke before I could finish all the levels and Softex never wanted to port it to Android.
Even the Siemens Mobile framework does not exists anymore so it was absolutely impossible to run the JAR and finish the game.
So I deciced to uncompile the JAR file (quite unreadable) and to extract the levels and some game behaviors. 

So this is a COMPLETE rewrite with Phaser 3 that I named.
All the 200 levels were in binary format and I struggled to decode them.
Then I transformed the levels into a Json format.

This is my first HTML5/JS/Phaser3 game project so it is not perfect.

Why Phaser 3 ? 
- I wanted to access the game from my PC and Smartphone in order to test it without rebuilding the whole thing on each device.
- My last HTML/JS experience is 10 years old now and I wanted to refresh my knowledge.
- Many websites (included Mozilla) recommended it for 2D games and as a mouse input framework.
- One year later I started the UML modeling I was tired to compare the best Game/Renering Engines frameworks and I needed to take a decision.
- I started to develop a pure JavaScript apprach (since the game has no platform dynamics) but it was a nightmare to figure out doing simple things like rad a file.
