    <h1>Guappo Junior Game Rules</h1>

    <p><b>Objective:</b><br>
    Guide all your cosmonaut bear friends to the honeycombs at the same time, avoiding traps and enemies.</p>

    <h3>Turn Sequence: Guappo, Friends, and Enemies</h3>

    <p>Each turn in Guappo Junior is divided into two main phases, and within the player phase, Guappo (the main hero) always moves first, followed by the other friends:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Player Phase (Guappo &amp; Friends):</b>
            <ul>
                <li>You choose a direction (up, down, left, right) for all your friends (including Guappo) to move.</li>
                <li><b>Guappo (the main hero) always moves first.</b> Then, each friend moves in order.</li>
                <li>If a friend cannot move (blocked by a wall, obstacle, or another friend), they stay in place for that turn.</li>
                <li>If a friend steps onto a trap or into an enemy, the level is lost immediately.</li>
                <li>If all friends reach their honeycomb at the same time, the level is won immediately.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Enemy Phase:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>After all friends have moved, enemies (like bees) take their turn.</li>
                <li>Each enemy moves according to its own pattern (e.g., horizontal, vertical, or other scripted paths).</li>
                <li>If an enemy moves onto a tile occupied by a bear, the level is lost immediately.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="important"><b>Important:</b><br>
    - The order of movement is always: all friends move first, then all enemies move.<br>
    - The puzzle is to find a sequence of moves that gets all friends to the goal without anyone being caught or left behind.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Rules:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Synchronize Your Team:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>All friends must reach their destination (the honeycombs) together. If even one is left behind, you don't win.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Turn-Based Movement:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Each turn, you plan and execute moves for all bears. After your move, enemies (like bees) take their turn.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Avoid Hazards:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The map is filled with traps and moving enemies. If any bear is caught by an enemy or falls into a trap, you lose the level.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Puzzle Logic:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Each level is a puzzle. You must find the right sequence of moves to get everyone to the goal safely and in sync.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Scoring:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The fewer moves you use, the higher your score. Try to solve each level as efficiently as possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Replay and Experiment:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>You can retry levels as many times as you want. Experiment with different strategies to find the optimal solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>Plan carefully, synchronize your team, dodge hazards, and reach the goal together!</p>
